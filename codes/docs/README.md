# 🧠 Quantum Virtual Mind (QVM)

**Quantum Virtual Mind (QVM)** is a quantum-graph-inspired simulation of cognitive systems, memory processing, recursive self-awareness, and harmonically governed decision-making.

- 🧩 Nodes = agentic components (Sense, Memory, Intellect, Action, Ego)
- 🔗 Edges = phase-coupled relationships (attention, memory trace, feedback)
- 🌀 Evolution = driven by quantum graph kernel + collapse dynamics
- 📊 Observable = Mind State Tensor (MST) representing internal state

## 🎯 Core Concepts

- `MindStateTensor`: Tracks recursive awareness and health state
- `AgentomeLayer`: Simulates roles like Ego, Intellect, and Memory
- `CollapseScheduler`: Governs recursive introspection and decision triggers
- `QGraphKernel`: Generates phase-evolving pathways of thought
- `IntrospectionEngine`: Extracts interpretability of internal MST
